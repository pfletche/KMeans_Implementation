Program Title: KMeans
Description: Computes KMeans clusters on a data set
Programmers: Paul Fletcher and Ben Buckwalter
Last Updated: 03/16/2021

The code for this program is contained in the KMeans.py file.

Run the program from the terminal: While in the KMeans directory run the
KMeans.py file with arguments for (arg1) the number of clusters, (arg2) the
number of iterations, and (arg3) the epsilon value.

For example, if number of clusters = 3, number of iterations = 10, and epsilon = 0,
the command should look as follows:

   $ python3 KMeans.py 3 10 0

Output: The code will output a file called clusters.csv which will contain the
cluster value and associated distance value for each row of data. We also include
the original class labels associated with the data set.
